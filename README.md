📌 Project 

This is a beginner-level Java project that simulates a simple Train Ticket Booking System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

The project demonstrates the use of:

Classes & Objects – to represent Trains, Passengers, and Bookings.

Encapsulation – to secure passenger details with private fields and getters/setters.

Interfaces – to define booking operations (book, cancel, view tickets).

Abstraction – hiding the booking logic implementation behind interfaces.

It is designed for students who are learning Java OOP and file handling basics

⚡ Features

View available trains.

Book tickets for passengers.

Cancel booked tickets.

View all booked tickets.

Store booking details using file handling (so data persists between runs).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (OOP Concepts)

File Handling for data storage
